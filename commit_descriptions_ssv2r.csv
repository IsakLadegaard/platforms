This commit should fix the problem where VPN connection is viewed as metered connections on Android P DP1. However as I only have an emulator to test, I can't tell if it really works but it should.

An interesting observation is that the developer can call setUnderlyingNetworks(arrayOfNulls(1)) to make the VPN connection always unmetered. This is more of a quick hack instead of a real fix. Source: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/adbf1d0/services/core/java/com/android/server/connectivity/Vpn.java#312

One may ask whether it's possible to fix this issue for Android 8.1. The short answer is not that I know of.
After some intensive source code reading, I found out that this is the commit that ""breaks"" whether VPN is metered for Android 8.1: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/43d2a1700b6eb1d804924c6a1e5e0161a13a5348%5E%21/
The key is that isActiveNetworkMetered() used to return getActiveNetworkInfo().isMetered() and now it uses the more up-to-date API getActiveNetwork(). However, getActiveNetworkInfo() ignores VPN connections while getActiveNetwork() prefers VPN connection. And since NetworkCapabilities for VPN Network is always metered by default, this ultimately causes the bug. One might be able to get around this bug by somehow calling NetworkAgent.sendNetworkCapabilities in the correct context.

"shadowsocks/shadowsocks-android","Mygod","12/15/2017","Update Kotlin"
"shadowsocks/shadowsocks-android","Mygod","12/15/2017","Implement direct boot awareness

To do direct boot, important files need to be moved to device storage (i.e. not as safe storage). The only thing sensitive is user credentials (server settings in each profile) and the config file passed to libss-*.so. In order to implement direct boot, at least the active profile has to be moved/copied to device storage.

This commit keeps profile information (and temporary data used by ProfileConfigFragment) and Shadowsocks config in credential storage and move everything else to device storage. In order to make direct boot work, active profile is also copied into device storage and Shadowsocks config file is created in device storage during direct boot. Cleanup of those information is also implemented.

Fixes #1457.

NB:

* `android:directBootAware` can't be used on application element. That seems to be used by system apps.
* Works fine with multi-user;
* Old GSM files are not migrated (see App.kt) to device storage."

Have. To. Do. More. Refinements.

Here's what happened in the buggy versions: (I think)

* `BootReceiver` starts which invokes `Utils.startSsService` which starts `ShadowsocksRunnerService`;
* `ShadowsocksRunnerService` binds to `BaseService`;
* 1s after it's connected, it invokes `bgService.use` which returns immediately after pushing `use` in the queue since it's an oneway method;
* Then `stopSelf` => `detachService`, `BaseService` now have nothing bound to it and not started either (neither foreground nor background), so the system can destroy it any time; (at this point, `BaseService.use` isn't invoked yet)
* `com.github.shadowsocks` process then probably exits since booting is a resource-heavy task, anyway it doesn't matter;
* Some time later `com.github.shadowsocks:bg` resumes running, and `BaseService` is stopped and destroyed. Now the system is no longer aware of this `BaseService` instance but it isn't garbage collected yet;
* `use` is finally invoked;
* `startService` is invoked in `startRunner` and the destroyed background service starts running; (bug of Android?)
* `startForeground` is invoked in `ShadowsocksNotification` but the system probably refused it since the service itself is already destroyed;
* When the main activity UI is brought up and requests binding, `com.github.shadowsocks:bg` which is unaware of the existing instance of `BaseService` creates another `BaseService` and thus everything gets messed up.

This commit fixes this by invoking `getState` (which isn't an oneway method) immediately after `use` so that `ShadowsocksRunnerService` will wait for `BaseService` to start itself before destroying itself and its connection to `BaseService`. And thus its return value is not used."

Previously a profile can exist in the following forms:

* `.ShadowsocksSettings` which uses Preferences to provide UI to tweak settings;
* `.aidl.Config` used for IPC;
* `<data dir>/shared_pref/com.github.shadowsocks_preferences.xml` which exists for no apparent reason.

Thus long code block can be seen whose purpose is simply converting the data from one form to another. This commit intends to remove the latter two by:

1. Using profile ID and take advantage of fs r/w lock SQLite uses for IPC and better extensibility;
2. Stop persisting redundant fields in the preferences file and update database directly."

Generate independent IVs in the server"
"shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go","ssoxer","06/14/2019","Remove `iv` from the `Cipher` type.

It is dangerous to have a single `iv` member, because there must be
separate IVs for encryption and decryption. Instead, store the IVs
implicitly inside the `cipher.Stream` objects. The `GetIv` and `GetKey`
functions were unused leftovers from OTA support, added in commit
89460d2e476940f0b702e4bdff4991152d9cdbbe."

Cipher cache should include encryption method in key"
"shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go","Xiaodu","08/14/2015","Cipher cache should include encryption method in key
... otherwise two servers with different encryption method but same
password will share the same cipher, and client will fail to authenticate.

Instead of using map[string]map[string]*ss.Cipher, just prepend password
with encryption method name and a delimiter ""|"" as cache key. Since there
are no encryption methods with ""|"" in their names (and unlikely any further
ones), it's safe to use this delimiter.

Another problem is that, no method provided ("""") is equivalent to ""table"",
but will have two entries in cipher cache. But it's hard to know the default
encryption method from package ss, and ""table"" is rarely used, this won't
be a big problem."

"shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev","Boyuan Yang","01/31/2020","tests/test.py: Make script compatible with python3

Currently the test script assumes the returned web page is always encoded in UTF-8, which might not be the case. It is likely that the real encoding is `ISO-8859-1` and that running the script under python3 will raise error:

```
<

100 11923    0 11923    0     0   184k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  187k
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""tests/test.py"", line 106, in <module>
    line = str(line, 'utf8')
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa0 in position 1105: invalid start byte
```
This pull request makes no assumption on the returned data and send the raw output to stderr as `bytes`. This should allow the test script to finish successfully when `tests/test.py` is run by python3."

"shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev","xnor","05/09/2018","Optimize resolv timer

Don't call ares_timeout since it does a search through all queries.
Instead, schedule a timer that fires after 1 second. If no activity happened
for over 1 second do ares timeout processing, otherwise reschedule the timer
to fire after the remaining timeout.
This also completely avoids the ev_timer_again calls for each single fd event."

allows to use pwgen to generate the initial password at the first

 - Debian 9.x Stretch / unstable
 - Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial (xenial-backports)
 - Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety

debhelper supports dh-autoreconf and dh-systemd by default, so we can
safely remove a few Build-Depends and dh params.

We also sync a few other files under debian/ folder with Debian release
3.0.2+ds-1~exp1."

* ss-libev: Introduce mode parameter for start_plugin

Since obfsproxy handles client and server in different ways, no matter
standalone or manged mode, so introduce the mode for start_plugin() to
support obfsproxy.

With more comments added to plugin.h for later developers.

* ss-libev: Move SS protocol plugin initialization code to start_ss_plugin

Move SS protocol plugin initialization to start_ss_plugin() function, as
the support for obfsproxy will not use that environment.

Also, remove the use of get_current_dir_name() which is a glibc
extension, such macro hack will just make code less readable.
Not to mention it already screw up code folding of vim.

* ss-libev: Introduce obfsproxy standalone mode support as plugin

Now shadowsocks-libev supports to use obfsproxy as plugin.

Currently we only support to use standalone(proxy) mode of obfsproxy, as
managed mode needs to use SOCKS5 as upstream forward, while ss-libev
doesn't support it yet.

And the output from plugin is just trashed for now.
Support to pipe them into stdout/stderr will be added later.

* Doc: Convert shadowsocks-libev man page to asciidoc

The port to asciidoc has some format change compared to old one.

The most obvious one is the options listed in SYNOPSIS.
Now the options list is not split into 2/3 columns, or we must use
asciidoc tables and introduce table frames.

Other small change includes the removal of AUTHOR sector, as it's not
an expendable method to update AUTHOR sector every time it gets updated.

Close #603

After use, sensitive data should be overwritten, but memset() and hand-written code can be silently stripped out by an optimizing compiler or by the linker.

The sodium_memzero() function tries to effectively zero len bytes starting at pnt, even if optimizations are being applied to the code.

The details as follows:
- variable initialization issue, modified them as Clang suggested
- data type mismatch when comparing, fix them either by casting or changing
  the data type of index of iterator
- get_sockaddr() in netutils may return -1 thus changed returning type from
  size_t to ssize_t, which makes Clang happier
- recvfrom() in udprelay is identical, fix this by creating local variable
  for comparison  and assign back to buf->len when returning value is acceptable

libsodium: Fix _FORTIFY_SOURCE redefined issue"
"shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev","Syrone Wong","08/02/2015","libsodium: Fix _FORTIFY_SOURCE redefined issue

If we already defined `CFLAGS=-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1`, it will still check `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` and
add it to CPPFLAGS. In this case, we redefine `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` to both 1 and 2 if compiler accepts `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`.

Fix this issue by checking whether `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` was defined or not.
If defined, do nothing. If not, then check `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`.

BTW, OpenWrt's buildroot uses `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1` for most targets by default."

Notes:
- Test cipher CFB support just in case (i.e. OpenWrt disabled it)
- Added some inline notes, please feel free to modify or remove them.
- Sorry for my bad English
- If you want to compile for OpenWrt, please make sure this hunk[1] not exists.
- Only tested on ARM mamba (Linksys WRT1900AC v1), it works.

missing many features comparing with log4rs."

* Make sslocal/ssserver TCP relay work successfully, disabled UDP and DNS relay temporary

* Handshake before performing actual read & write

* Wraps timeout logic into a Connection<S> struct

* Make UDP relay work again

* Local uses copy directly

* Completely removed unused ssdns

* Fixed test

* Uses tokio::main macro for main entrance

* Fixed a missing use in local.rs

* Updated travis openssl to 1.1.0L

* Windows signal

* Migrated tokio 0.2 release with std::future support

* Uses spawn_blocking only with threaded runtime

* Killing all detached Tasks if server is exited

* Updated version to v1.8.0

* Removed unused pin-project

* Uses dns resolver built in tokio

* Explicitly uses threaded scheduler by default

* Reverted, it is threaded scheduler by default

* Updated bytes to v0.5

* Updated many dependencies

* Add a tunnel app (#175)

It can be used to benchmark.

Usage:
sstunnel -v -s 127.0.0.1:8488 -m plain -k password -b 127.0.0.1:1090 -f 127.0.0.1:5201

""-f xxx"" : the target/forwad address xxx

* Removed unused remote-dns config field (ssdns is removed)

* Separated TCP local tunneling to its own module

* Implements FromStr for Address

* Fixed typo

* Add tunnel unit test

* Updated tokio to v0.2.2, fixed basic scheduler bug

* Removed Connection, uses try_timeout instead. Revert back to use 8K buffer

* Revert ""Removed Connection, uses try_timeout instead. Revert back to use 8K buffer""

Info from stackoverflow:

If I want to be sure that it will be locked for all threads inside my

The lock object has to be static, if it locks access to static state.
Otherwise it has to be instance, because there's no need to lock state of
one class instance, and prevent other threads to work with another class
instance at the same time.

everyone says that the object has to be ""readonly"" I didn't found the

Well, it doesn't have to be. This is just a best practice, which helps you

Becuase we put handler.Start() call after timeout check and
lastActivity is initialized in Start(), this will lead to a
incorrect timeout.

Also because we will call handler.Start() right after the
constructor and timeout check, so it makes no difference
where we put the initializtion of lastActivity. We won't do
this again in Start() because DateTime.Now will consumes a
lot of cpu time."
"shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows","noisyfox","09/17/2016","Fix #710

When using http proxy, this will cause distinct latency
if we are trying to resolve localhost.

Currently it's unnecessary to do that because our privoxy
doesn't listern on ipv6 address, so it's ok to hard code
the ipv4 address.

There is a plan to add a cache to record the ipv6 connectivity
so that we needn't to try both ipv4 and ipv6 every time when we
attempt to connect a DnsEndPoint."

"shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows","Syrone Wong","09/17/2016","Add global hotkey support (#724)

Design:

Use the plain string for both config and hotkey parsing
and make use of KeyConverter, ModifierKeysConverter
to make it more rubust.

Find corresponding label (to display operation result) and callback (to do the real work) based on textbox name. In this case, they should be named as `<Feature-Name><Control-Name>`.

ShowLogsTextBox,
ShowLogsLabel,
ShowLogsCallback.

If this requirement doesn't meet, throw an exception at runtime.

Logic:

How to input keys:
1. put focus in the corresponding textbox
2. press the key combination you want to use
3. when you think it is ready, release all keys
4. the textbox shows your input

How to change keys:
1. put focus in the corresponding textbox
2. press BackSpace to clear content
3. re-input new one

How to deactivate:
1. clear content in the textbox
2. press OK button

Meaning of label color:
- Green: this combination is not occupied by other programs and register successfully
- Yellow: this combination is occupied by other programs and you have to change to another one
- Transparent without color: initial status

no repeat random number generator by GangZhuo"
"shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows","Gang Zhuo","09/15/2015","no repeat random number generator

The stock code use class Random to generate IV, the Random is pseudo random number generator. The IV maybe repeat, this will cause shadowsocks-libev closed the sockets with the error message 'invalid password or cipher'. Reference https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev/issues/389

Solution is use class RNGCryptoServiceProvider to generate IV, of course it's lower performance, but a little bit."

* Add fake dns

A new config object ""fake"" in DnsObject for toggling fake dns function

Compare with sniffing, fake dns is not limited to http and tls traffic.
It works across all inbounds. For example, when dns request come
from one inbound, the local DNS server of v2ray will response with a
unique fake IP for every unique domain name. Then later on v2ray
received a request to one of the fake IP from any inbounds, it will
override the request destination with the previously saved domain.

By default, v2ray cache up to 65535 addresses. The old records will
be discarded bases on LRU. The fake IP will be 240.x.x.x

* fix an edge case when encounter a fake IP in use

* Move lru to common.cache package

* Added the necessary change to obtain request IP from sniffer

* Refactor the code so that it may stop depending on global variables in the future.

* Replace string manipulation code with more generic codes, hopefully this will work for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

* Try to use IPv4 version of address if possible

* Added Test Case for Fake Dns

* Added More Test Case for Fake Dns

* Stop user from creating a instance with LRU size more than subnet size, it will create a infinite loop

* Move Fake DNS to a separate package

* Generated Code for fakedns

* Encapsulate Fake DNS as a Instance wide service

* Added Support for metadata sniffer, which will be used for Fake DNS

"v2fly/v2ray-core","database64128","12/16/2020","🎳 Refine socks5 server UdpAssociate response behavior (#523)

- Previously, without specifying the server IP, the remote address in the response to a UdpAssoicate command is `127.0.0.1`, which might break UDP for non-localhost clients.
- This commit changes it so that, localhost clients get responses with the corresponding loopback IP, non-localhost clients get responses with the corresponding `net.AnyIP` or `net.AnyIPv6`.
- The new behavior is also consistent with many other implementations. So the compatibility is guaranteed. It also makes specifying server IP optional."

- When you connect to a non-localhost socks5 server, in the response of a UdpAssociate from a socks5 server, the remote address may be `::` or `0.0.0.0`. The previous behavior is to connect to the remote address in the response, which obviously fails.
- This commit changes the behavior to dial to the outbound server's address when the remote address in the response is `::` or `0.0.0.0`.
- Rename `cmdUDPPort` to `cmdUDPAssociate` for clarity."

This fix addresses a potential denial-of-service (DoS) vector that can cause an integer overflow in the presence of malicious WebSocket frames.

The fix adds additional checks against the remaining bytes on a connection, as well as a test to prevent regression.

Credit to Max Justicz (https://justi.cz/) for discovering and reporting this, as well as providing a robust PoC and review.

Previously v2ray can not be built on illumos due to following reasons:
1. missing build tags in transport/internet/sockopt_other.go
2. many definitions in syscall does not exist on illumos
This commit addresses these problems by adding missing build tags, and
updates those missing syscall deps on illumos to use x/sys/unix."

This fix addresses a potential denial-of-service (DoS) vector that can cause an integer overflow in the presence of malicious WebSocket frames.

The fix adds additional checks against the remaining bytes on a connection, as well as a test to prevent regression.

Credit to Max Justicz (https://justi.cz/) for discovering and reporting this, as well as providing a robust PoC and review.
